# 🧑🏻‍💻 About me

I am currently a junior undergraduate student from [Mixed Class, Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/) of [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), majoring in Computer Science and Technology. My advisors are professor [Chunhua Shen](https://cshen.github.io/) and [Hao Chen](https://stan-haochen.github.io/) who are affiliated to [State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/english.html).

I am keenly interested in research topics associated with Artificial Intelligence assisted Biomolecule Design, Materials&Drug Discovery, and Diffusion Models. My prior research experience encompasses protein design and the prediction of crystal structures and properties. Currently, I am engaged in exploring diverse areas, including co-designing protein structures and sequences, utilizing diffusion models for the creation of innovative crystal structures, protein motif scaffolding, and the design of protein binders.

- The code will be released after being sorted out. 

**Introduction**

- We propose a novel structure encoder, which can address the atom representation bottleneck observed in traditional IPA encoders.

# 🏯 Research Experience
## State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University

*Advisors*: Prof. [Chunhua Shen](https://cshen.github.io) & Prof. [Hao Chen](https://stan-haochen.github.io/) *(Oct.2022 - Present)*

I contributed to a protein project by proposing a novel structure encoder, addressing the atom representation bottleneck observed in traditional IPA encoders. The introduced encoder exhibited superior designability (**67.04%** vs. 53.58%) and diversity (**66.54%** vs. 51.98%) compared to the previous model. In both Inverse Folding and Protein Design tasks, this innovative encoder consistently outperformed its predecessor.
